### Summary:

Organization systems are useful, but often, they are so tightly structured it is hard to adapt them to fit all of your daily needs. A bullet journal is a highly customizable and efficient way to organize tasks, notes, and due dates. In its basic form, it is a set of checklists and symbols used to track tasks and progress on tasks. This is an online/digital version of a bullet journal.

### Users:

Young people, typically students, as at least for the analog version, the bullet journal demographic seems to be high school and college students looking for more free-form ways to organize their information.

### MVP:

The most basic form of a bullet journal would be very similar to a checklist. The user needs to be able to enter lines of text as goals or things they want to accomplish. Each should be accompanied by a small square (or another shape) that the user can mark off in some way (likely filling the square in with color) when the task is completed.

### Functionality:

### Installation Steps:

### Issues:

The main issues that came up during development revolved around unfamiliarity with how everything worked and was interacting with each other. The problems that were the most challenging for me were adding editing and deleting functionality and having those actually work properly.
