### Summary:

Organization systems are useful, but often, they are so tightly structured it is hard to adapt them to fit all of your daily needs. A bullet journal is a highly customizable and efficient way to organize tasks, notes, and due dates. In its basic form, it is a set of checklists and symbols used to track tasks and progress on tasks. This is an online/digital version of a bullet journal.

### Users:

Young people, typically students, as at least for the analog version, the bullet journal demographic seems to be high school and college students looking for more free-form ways to organize their information.

### MVP:

The most basic form of a bullet journal would be very similar to a checklist. The user needs to be able to enter lines of text as goals or things they want to accomplish. Each should be accompanied by a small square (or another shape) that the user can mark off in some way (likely filling the square in with color) when the task is completed.
