### Summary:

Organization systems are useful, but often, they are so tightly structured it is hard to adapt them to fit all of your daily needs. A bullet journal

### MVP:

The most basic form of a bullet journal would be very similar to a checklist. The user needs to be able to enter lines of text as goals or things they want to accomplish. Each should be accompanied by a small square (or another shape) that the user can mark off in some way (likely filling the square in with color) when the task is completed.
